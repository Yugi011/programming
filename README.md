# 📘 CCOM 3001 - Programming I  

This repository contains my assignments, exercises, and projects from **CCOM 3001: Programming I**, taken during my **first year, first semester** at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo (UPRA).  

The course introduced me to the fundamentals of programming using **C++**, focusing on problem-solving, structured programming, and algorithmic thinking.
